    <h1>WHAT DO I DO ON THIS CHANNEL?</h1>
    
    <p>I usually make different useful and interesting contents for those who are interested in studying abroad and working hard to accomplish their goals. I also help people improve their English and Korean by sending educational videos of mine.</p>
    <p>I also share something interesting from my everyday life. Let us say, if I find something intriguing and practical that can be beneficial for others as well, I share it on my channel there and then.</p>
    <p>I hope to see you on my channel. I believe, we can learn and grow together and make the world a better place by bettering ourselves every single day.</p>
